# Dog Identifier

This project is a simple image classifier built with TensorFlow and Keras to identify whether an image contains a dog or not.

## Files

- `main.py`: This script contains the training code for the model.
- `test.py`: This script contains code to test the trained model on new images.
- `models/`: Directory to store saved models.
- `data/`: Directory containing the training data.
- `test.jpg`: Sample image for testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Place your training images in the `data/` directory, organized into subdirectories for each class.
2. Run `main.py` to train the model.
3. Test the trained model by running `test.py` with your own images.

## Instructions

- Ensure Python and required packages are installed.
- Organize training images into appropriate directories.
- Adjust hyperparameters or model architecture in `main.py` as needed.
- Use `test.py` to evaluate the model's performance on new images.
